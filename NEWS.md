### Major Features

#### Dashboard Interface
* **Modern bs4Dash Interface**: Clean, responsive dashboard with proper tab navigation
* **Three-Tab Structure**: Upload/Management, Dataset Explorer, and Analysis
* **Demo Mode**: Built-in sample datasets (DM, AE, VS domains) with `run_databox(demo_data = TRUE)`
* **Auto-Navigation**: Automatically switches to Explorer tab when data is loaded

#### Data Management
* **Multi-Format Support**: Load XPT, CSV, and TXT files seamlessly
* **Interactive File Selection**: Upload multiple files with selection interface
* **Robust Loading**: Comprehensive error handling with progress indicators
* **Data Validation**: Built-in dataset validation with quality checks

#### Dataset Explorer
* **Interactive Preview**: Filterable, searchable data tables with reactable
* **Variable Information**: Comprehensive metadata including types, labels, missing data
* **Export Functionality**: Download filtered datasets as CSV files
* **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and empty state handling

#### Analysis Suite
* **Metadata Explorer**: Variable labels, data dictionary, CDISC compliance checks
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Distribution plots, missing data patterns, data quality metrics
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Histograms, boxplots with error handling
* **Quality Assessment**: Duplicate detection, constant variables, missing data analysis

### Technical Improvements

#### User Experience
* **Loading Indicators**: shinycssloaders integration for all async operations
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and graceful fallbacks
* **Notifications**: Success/warning/error feedback throughout the interface
* **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

#### Code Quality
* **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation with dedicated Shiny modules
* **Input Validation**: Edge case handling for empty datasets, constant variables
* **Utility Functions**: Reusable validation and data handling functions
* **Comprehensive Testing**: testthat framework with sample tests

### Dependencies
* **Core**: shiny, bs4Dash, reactable, DT
* **Data Processing**: haven, readr, dplyr, data.table
* **UI Enhancement**: shinycssloaders, shinyWidgets
* **Testing**: testthat framework

### Sample Data
* **Demographics (DM)**: Subject demographics with standard CDISC variables
* **Adverse Events (AE)**: Adverse event data with MedDRA terms
* **Vital Signs (VS)**: Vital signs measurements and metadata

### Installation & Usage

```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("PawanRamaMali/databoxR")

# Launch with demo data for immediate exploration
library(databoxR)
run_databox(demo_data = TRUE)

# Launch for file upload workflow
run_databox()
```

### Breaking Changes
None - this is the first stable release.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed tab navigation issues with proper bs4Dash implementation
* Resolved reactable rendering errors with proper NAMESPACE imports
* Improved error handling for edge cases in data loading
* Fixed responsive layout issues in Analysis tab

### Known Limitations
* Basic CDISC validation (extensible framework in place)
* Base R graphics (plotly integration planned for future releases)
* No advanced statistical modeling (focused on exploration)

### Future Roadmap
* Enhanced CDISC validation rules and Define.xml integration
* Advanced statistical summaries and modeling capabilities
* Cross-domain linking and relationship analysis
* Interactive plotly visualizations
* Custom report generation and export options
