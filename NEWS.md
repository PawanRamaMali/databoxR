# databoxR 0.1.1

## Enhanced UI and Visualization Update 🎨

### New Features
* **Enhanced Tab Design**: Professional pill-style tabs with proper spacing, gradients, and visual separation
* **Plotly Integration**: Complete migration from base R graphics to interactive plotly visualizations
* **Improved Demo Data**: Synthetic CDISC-compliant data generation without file I/O dependencies
* **Advanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful error recovery throughout the application

### UI Improvements
* **Professional Tab Styling**: Enhanced tab appearance with gradient backgrounds, proper padding, and visual separation
* **Interactive Visualizations**: All charts now use plotly for better interactivity and responsiveness
* **No Margin Issues**: Eliminated "figure margins too large" errors by migrating to plotly
* **Consistent Spacing**: Proper 10px gaps between icons and text, 12px margins between tabs
* **Modern Card Design**: Enhanced card layouts with Bootstrap styling and shadows

### Bug Fixes
* **Package Loading**: Fixed critical NAMESPACE import issues including missing h1, h2 HTML functions
* **Escape Sequences**: Resolved `'\|' is an unrecognized escape` error in dataset_loader.R
* **Notification Types**: Fixed invalid showNotification parameters (changed "success"/"info" to "message")
* **Demo Data Issues**: Eliminated CSV file dependencies with direct synthetic data generation
* **JavaScript Errors**: Removed problematic JS() function calls causing browser errors

### Technical Improvements
* **Plotly Visualizations**: Complete migration to plotly for all charts (histograms, boxplots, density, violin plots)
* **Robust Data Loading**: Enhanced read_sdtm_adam() function with better error handling
* **Performance Optimization**: Data sampling for large datasets (>10K rows) to improve rendering speed
* **Memory Management**: Better handling of large datasets with progress notifications

# databoxR 0.1.0

## First Stable Release 🚀

This is the first stable release of **databoxR**, a comprehensive Shiny-based R package for exploring SDTM and ADaM clinical trial datasets with a Windows Explorer-style interface.

### Major Features

#### Dashboard Interface
* **Modern bs4Dash Interface**: Clean, responsive dashboard with proper tab navigation
* **Three-Tab Structure**: Upload/Management, Dataset Explorer, and Analysis
* **Demo Mode**: Built-in sample datasets (DM, AE, VS domains) with `run_databox(demo_data = TRUE)`
* **Auto-Navigation**: Automatically switches to Explorer tab when data is loaded

#### Data Management
* **Multi-Format Support**: Load XPT, CSV, and TXT files seamlessly
* **Interactive File Selection**: Upload multiple files with selection interface
* **Robust Loading**: Comprehensive error handling with progress indicators
* **Data Validation**: Built-in dataset validation with quality checks

#### Dataset Explorer
* **Interactive Preview**: Filterable, searchable data tables with reactable
* **Variable Information**: Comprehensive metadata including types, labels, missing data
* **Export Functionality**: Download filtered datasets as CSV files
* **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and empty state handling

#### Analysis Suite
* **Metadata Explorer**: Variable labels, data dictionary, CDISC compliance checks
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Distribution plots, missing data patterns, data quality metrics
* **Interactive Plotly Visualizations**: Modern interactive charts with zoom, pan, and hover capabilities
* **Quality Assessment**: Duplicate detection, constant variables, missing data analysis

### Technical Improvements

#### User Experience
* **Loading Indicators**: shinycssloaders integration for all async operations
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and graceful fallbacks
* **Notifications**: Success/warning/error feedback throughout the interface
* **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

#### Code Quality
* **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation with dedicated Shiny modules
* **Input Validation**: Edge case handling for empty datasets, constant variables
* **Utility Functions**: Reusable validation and data handling functions
* **Comprehensive Testing**: testthat framework with sample tests

### Dependencies
* **Core**: shiny, bs4Dash, reactable, DT
* **Data Processing**: haven, readr, dplyr, data.table
* **UI Enhancement**: shinycssloaders, shinyWidgets
* **Visualization**: plotly (NEW in 0.1.1)
* **Testing**: testthat framework

### Sample Data
* **Demographics (DM)**: Subject demographics with standard CDISC variables
* **Adverse Events (AE)**: Adverse event data with MedDRA terms
* **Vital Signs (VS)**: Vital signs measurements and metadata

### Installation & Usage

```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("PawanRamaMali/databoxR")

# Launch with demo data for immediate exploration
library(databoxR)
run_databox(demo_data = TRUE)

# Launch for file upload workflow
run_databox()
```

### Breaking Changes
None - this is the first stable release.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed tab navigation issues with proper bs4Dash implementation
* Resolved reactable rendering errors with proper NAMESPACE imports
* Improved error handling for edge cases in data loading
* Fixed responsive layout issues in Analysis tab

### Known Limitations
* Basic CDISC validation (extensible framework in place)
* No advanced statistical modeling (focused on exploration)
* Limited cross-domain linking capabilities

### Future Roadmap
* Enhanced CDISC validation rules and Define.xml integration
* Advanced statistical summaries and modeling capabilities
* Cross-domain linking and relationship analysis
* Custom report generation and export options
* Advanced plotly dashboard features
